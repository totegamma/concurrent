# Firestore backend

`backends.database: firestore` runs concrnt on Cloud Firestore (Native mode)
instead of PostgreSQL. Redis and memcached are still required.

## One-time setup

```sh
PROJECT=my-project; REGION=asia-northeast1; DB="(default)"   # or a named database
gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com --project "$PROJECT"
gcloud firestore databases create --project "$PROJECT" --database="$DB" \
  --location="$REGION" --type=firestore-native --delete-protection --enable-pitr
```

The free tier applies to one database per project; a named database
(`--database=concrnt`) keeps `(default)` free for other uses but is billed
from the first read.

## Indexes (deploy BEFORE switching traffic)

`firestore.indexes.json` is generated from the query shapes in
`internal/infra/repository/firestore/shapes.go`; `go test` fails when the two
drift. Queries that lack a composite index fail with `FailedPrecondition`
(the log carries the console URL to create it), and the emulator does not
enforce indexes, so deploy them first and wait for `READY`:

```sh
cd deploy/firestore
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --project "$PROJECT"   # add "database" to firebase.json for a named DB
# or, without the Firebase CLI:
PROJECT="$PROJECT" DATABASE="$DB" sh apply-indexes.sh
gcloud firestore indexes composite list --project "$PROJECT" --database="$DB"
```

The server also probes every query shape once at startup and logs any
missing index.

## Credentials

The client uses Application Default Credentials. On GKE Autopilot bind the
pod's Kubernetes service account through Workload Identity and grant it
`roles/datastore.user` (index deployment needs `roles/datastore.indexAdmin`;
give that to operators/CI, not the pod):

```sh
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT" --role=roles/datastore.user \
  --member="principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$PROJECT.svc.id.goog/subject/ns/$NAMESPACE/sa/$KSA"
```

Config:

```yaml
backends:
  database: firestore
  firestore:
    projectID: my-project      # optional on GKE (detected from the metadata server)
    databaseID: concrnt        # optional, "(default)" when omitted
```

Locally, `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080` points the client at an
emulator:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:emulators \
  gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Operational notes

- `conctl op gc-commitlog` / `dump-commitlog` / `import-commitlog` /
  `create-account` work on both backends. `repair-*` and `migrate-*` are
  Postgres-only.
- Firestore has no cascading deletes; the repository fans them out itself
  (record delete removes the key and its associations, GC removes everything
  hanging off a commit). Re-running GC finishes a partially failed pass.
- Grouped counts (reaction counts, follower counts) scan the matching
  documents: cost is one read per association/ack of the target.
- Commit ids are time-ordered CDIDs, so `commits`/`records`/`associations`
  have sequential document ids and timestamps: Firestore caps such
  collections around 500 writes/s (500/50/5 ramp-up). Irrelevant at small
  scale, but do not expect Postgres-level write throughput.
- Large string fields (documents, proofs, policies, well-known) have their
  single-field indexes disabled in `firestore.indexes.json`; querying them
  is not supported.
